## Website Design

Credit for the original design and inspiration of this goes to [Erik Eng](http://erikeng.se/). While many of his design elements are still in use in my website's current design, I have made the following changes to his code:

* Translated to english
* Cleaned up the HTML code and stripped out most of the social integration
* Modified some of the styles and layouts
* Eliminated the need to compile client-side before deploying

I've also added some more GitHub-style colors and icons to the design. All of the code for this version is now W3C valid and follows all HTML5 standards.
